"Prescribed clindamycin for a tooth infection after a two year root canal. I am allergic to penicillin. The medication kicked in about day 2 and I was feeling a lot better.  However on day 3, I began to have severe chest pain, a feeling like something was stuck in my throat, severe burning in my esophagus, no appetite and clay colored stool.  I thought it was just severe heartburn but when it didn't go away after a couple of days, I went to the ER.  They ran all types of tests and all checked out normal--even gave me ""cocktail"" to coat my esophagus, prescribed Pepcid AC for the inflammation of my esophagus and sent me home. I was still in severe pain. Never once did they consider that it was an adverse reaction to the medication.  I returned home and did extensive research and found that several of my symptoms were rare side effects of the medication. I immediately stopped taking it. Things got worse before they got better. My chest pain and burning sensation episodes intensified as well as the onset of bloody diarrhea. This lasted for another 2-3 days.  I am feeling much better but I have now been off of it for about 7 days and I no longer have the burning in my esophagus and can eat something other than soup, and no more diarrhea or crazy colored stool.

My husband died from internal bleeding because the Kaiser doctors kept my husband on warfarin for more than six years and ignored his symptoms.  Warfarin is a very dangerous drug and patients are not being informed of this.  It is possible that the doctors are ignorant of this also.  Kaiser has decided to put as many old people as possible on warfarin because bleeding incidents are cheaper for them to treat than are stroke incidents.  This is very bad medicine.

"I don't know if they are all related to warfarin, or by interaction with the other meds I have to take, but I have had quite a few side effects. The most distressing problem, which seems to be getting worse, is blurry vision. I have to have my eyes checked every 6 months because of a med I have to take for Lupus. This drug does not cause blurriness, it has a different affect on the eye so I'm certain it's not that med. I had my eyes checked 12/07 & got new glasses (which I knew I needed). I had my next 6 month appt very recently & my vision acquity was exactly as it was in December. However, the later in the day, or the more I've used them, the blurrier my closeup world gets. I'm very near-sighted, so for the most part it's easier for me to take my glasses off to read vs. using bifocals.

When typing in website addresses, I have to get within a few inches of my monitor in order to read whats been typed or to read any website address.  I'm still trying to research warfarin to see if I can find additional info about this increasingly problematic condition.

Other than that, I had to switch to Lovenox for the first trimester of my pregnancy, but that's okay. Besides the med changes and close monitoring, even pregnancy and childbirth were okay.

been on pravastatin for obout one year.  My chol. went down a lot but about 3 mo. into it I started a dry cough this progressed to a persistent cough with a feeling of not getting a full breath.  Then I started wheezing when lying down and my cough turned to choking bouts.  By then I started suspecting my med.- its the only med I am on.  So I looked on a few web sites and found others with same probems-so I stopped taking it and by the third day the full feeling in my lungs was gone-by the end of week coughing slowed down and now a week and a half later only shows up a night when I first lay down.I am 100% sure the pravastatin caused this I might be able to live with high chol. but I sure can't live with non-functioning lungs.

"Side effects were too terrible.
First 5 days: drowsy, nausea, dry coughs.  Acceptable, because comparing to the pain to pass blood urine, they were fine.

Day 6: High fever, chest pain, shortness of breath. Went to hospital, chest x-ray showed haziness on the bottom of one side of my lung. Covid negative. white blood cells only slightly above the normal limit. Diagnosed with pneumonia, so they gave me antibiotics, but it didnât work, still high fever. The doctors had no clue why it didnât work, after a long time my body temperature was still very high. Then they just gave me Tylenol to lower my body temperature, it worked.

"I have been having on-again-off again UTIs for the last 19 months.  My doctor always put me on cipro and it always helped.

I took it and thought 'oh great! It'll be gone for good.'.  I finished the medication and 2 days later I swelled up around the face (although luckily not enough to cut off the breathing) and I spent my Saturday taking benedryl.  After all day of it not working I went back to the urgent care clinic and was given predinsone and pepcid.  Although both helped, the swelling has not fully gone away. Although I do have allergies, I did NOTHING that day that could have given me a reaction like this.

I was taking 2 x 150 mg 4 times a day. Based on what the pharmicist said and the reviews on here I was terrified of taking this drug, so here is what I did to help limit the side effects with great success so far. 1) I made sure to always eat some food with-in an hour of taking. 2)Prior to each dose I ate 4 oz of Yoplait yogurt - make sure it contains ""Live Active Cultures"" 3) I drank a full 16 oz bottle of water with each dose and plenty of water throughout the day. 4) I made sure not to lay down for 30 mins after taking 4) I made sure to take at 6 hr intervals.

I strongly recommend to not drink any alcohol while on this antibiotic!! As with any antibiotic I am going to continue eating yogurt on a daily basis to help rebuild the probiotics in my body. Also I'm not a medical professional, but I would never take an antibiotic as a ""precaution"" against infection because if there is no infection to kill then all there is for the medicine to attack is the good bacteria in you.

"I began taking clindamycin (150mg capsules) because I had a tooth that was infected. Since taking this drug, I have been experiencing dull headaches and I just experienced one last night that lasted until this morning. It wasn't unbearable but annoying because there was no reason or rhyme for it except the medication. Initially, it felt like someone was taking the ball of their index finger and constantly pressing against my temple (like a very mild throb). When I cough, I can feel a soreness in that area which scares me. I have experienced very mild diarreah as well. The swelling in the root of my mouth from the infected tooth has gone down and I can chew without any discomfort. However, I have 6 capsules left that I will not take. My appointment is this Friday (May 31st). I made a decision that my tooth is in good enough condition to pull without me continuing to use this scary drug.Read More Read Less",['clindamycin'],"['tooth that was infected', 'very mild diarreah', 'dull headaches', 'swelling in the root of my mouth']","[('clindamycin', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'dull headaches'), ('clindamycin', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'very mild diarreah'), ('clindamycin', 'has_positive_reaction', 'swelling in the root of my mouth')]"
"After being prescribed this by my dentist for an gum infection, I completed the 8 day regimen without issues.  About a week afterwards, I started suffering severe diarrhea, inflamed lower bowel and alien stools that defy description.  This was more than simple diarrhea and severe in every sense of the word.  OTC solutions, including pro-biotics did nothing.  Suffering, I went to a GP and he ended up prescribing Flagyl (Metronidazole) and me leaving a stool sample.  Conditions immediately improved and the test results all came back negative.  I finished the 10 day regimen without incident and movements continued to improve, though still not normal.  About 4 days after finishing, I almost immediately went back to the original symptoms, only worse.  This all culminated in my admitting myself to the ER and spending 3 days in the hospital. I was told I had a clostridium difficile infection as a result of taking the Clindamycin.  It was expained that the Clindamycin had killed off a spectrum of bacteria in my system leaving the previously in-check CDiff bacteria free to flourish.  This bacteria will eat the lining of your colon/bowel and is potentially life threatening.      All I know is, this whole experience has resulted in 9 days off work, +$20k in hospital fees and suffering like I've never experienced before.

I was given 5 different abx, which were ineffective. I wound up being hospitalized for 5 days, and received clindamycin and augmentin around the clock. They worked well together, and got rid of the swelling. HOWEVER- I had major issues with heartburn, diarreah, upset stomach, and just general weakness while taking the medications.

"I was prescribed 150 mg. 4X daily by an endodotist in preparation for a root canal.  Taking four doses daily felt like too many. Initially, I had some mild digestive complaints: acidity, bloating, burping, and hiccups. Two days into use, I developed an persistent nagging vise-like headache, not migraine, which I didn't at first link to the medication. The headache was accompanied by mental fogginess and some dizziness as well. The headache only stopped when I discontinued the antibiotic two days sooner than prescribed--after consulting a pharmacist. What ultimately made me stop was a marked rash on the trunk (which was noticeable on the third day into treatment and which subsequently spread to my arms and legs). The discomfort from the itching was intense. Benedryl has provided some minor relief.  However, two days after my discontinuing clindamycin HCL, the rash persists and seems to have gained even more ground. As of yet, I'm glad to report that it is not on my face and neck--but I've got it pretty much everywhere else. Having read the posts by others, many of whom have had severe diarrhea--sometimes well after completing this medication, I am making a serious effort to use probiotics and yogurt to avoid c. difficile. If you must take this medication, I would strongly urge you to attend to and report side effects quickly. Do not believe that taking an antihistamine to deal with the itching will solve the problem--as I was lulled into believing.I wish I'd stopped using the drug earlier. I would also recommend that you request an alternate antibiotic.  Previous experience with metronidazole proved to be far less problematic for me.

They did a spinal tap, multiple blood cultures, CT scan and everything came back fine. The only test that came back was the immune system nuclear test. She had a high level of autoantibodies in her blood.  The doctor said he thinks she may have an autoimmune disorder. He said her symptoms point to Lupus.  However, an infectious doctor came in and said she thought it was caused by an allergic reation to the medicine.  She was in the hospital for 4 days. She has been out a few days and is feeling better.  But she has an appt. with an infectious doctor and a rhumatoid doctor to make sure she dosent have lupus or another autoimmune disorder.  I have been reading about this drug and it can actually cause lupus and many other various diseases. Apparently, you can develop conditions months to years after taking it.  My daughter was extremely healthy before she took this drug. She could have died from the reation of this drug and now her life and helth may be at risk of another condition as a rRead More Read Less","['steroids', 'Kflex', 'Bactrim', 'bactrim', 'benodryl', 'antibiotics']","['symptoms point to Lupus', 'blood pressure was 50/40', 'throw up violently', 'hives', 'whites of her eyes turned red like blood', 'chills', 'almost convulsing', 'rash on her torso', 'extreme fatigue', 'lupus and many other various diseases', 'fever', 'high level of autoantibodies in her blood', 'itching', 'shaking', 'allergic reation to the medicine', 'migrains', 'turned red as a tomatoe', 'throwing up', 'severe abdomenal pain', 'swelling']","[('bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'migrains'), ('bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'chills'), ('bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'fever'), ('bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'extreme fatigue'), ('bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'throwing up'), ('Kflex', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'hives'), ('Kflex', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'swelling'), ('Kflex', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'itching'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'throw up violently'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'shaking'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'chills'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'turned red as a tomatoe'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'whites of her eyes turned red like blood'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'severe abdomenal pain'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'almost convulsing'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'blood pressure was 50/40'), ('Bactrim', 'has_adverse_drug_reaction', 'lupus and many other various diseases')]"
"Hopefully someone here can answer a question for me. I  went to my family doctor this morning well, yesterday morning now because I have a boil on my hiney. They tried to pop it but nothing would come out. Before I went in it was about an inch wide and now it is (under the skin)bigger than a golf ball. I ate a sandwhich and took my first bactrim and a loratab 5mg. I started getting a headache so I thought it was the pain pill causing it. I took my second dose 12 hours later with food and I didnt take a pain pill. About 2 hours later I started feeling really nausuated. Has anyone here ever heard of a doctor giving bactrim for a boil?Read More Read Less","['loratab', 'bactrim']","['feeling really nausuated', 'boil on my hiney', 'headache']",[]
"This is the only antibiotic I've ever used that is both effective and without side effects for me. I just take it with plenty of water or juice and have some yogurt each day.  I took bactrim for a sinus infection that gave me a raw sore throat, earache, and hacking cough. I also had clumps of icky thick mucous that I kept swallowing which only made me nauseous to boot.   Well,within 2 days of my 14 day course of bactrim DS, I felt light years better!  This stuff is great.

"I was told i had a severe uti infection. I had chills, no appetite, throwing up. After two doses i was in EXTREME pain. It seemed to intensify the the pain i already had with the infection. It gave me crazy anxiety and i was CONVINCED i was going to die and was having panic attacks. I had insomnia and intense diarrhea. I then broke out in a rash and a high fever. Also had weird symptoms like my teeth hurting and i couldn't eat anything. I spent the night shaking, rolling in pain, wanting to sleep, and praying for the medicine to kick in so i felt better. I saw doctor in the morning and she sent me straight to the hospital. At the time i thought it was my infection that made me feel this way, because i had never had a reaction to any medication before, later the doctor said it was a reaction to bactrim.
